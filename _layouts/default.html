    <p>
    Skip lists are data structures which are used in place of balanced trees. 
    It uses probabilistic balancing rather than enforced strict balancing like in BST,AVL etc hence 
    as a result its algorithms are simpler and significantly faster than algorithms in case of BST , AVL etc.</p>
 
    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
Binary trees are used for representing abstract data types such as dictionaries and ordered lists. 
It works better when elements are inserted in random order but when elements are inserted in order(particular order) it gives poor performance. 
It means there is an input sequence which consistently gives worst case
      If it is possible to randomly permute the input it works well with high probability . 
<b>But in information retrieval queries must be answered on-line so randomly permuting the input is impractical.</b> 
    In binary tree we satisfy certain balance conditions and assure good performance.
 </p> 
 
<p>SKIP-LISTS are probabilistic alternative to balanced trees.
  They are balanced by consulting a random number generator. 
  <b>Skip lists have bad worst-case performance,but no input sequence consistently produce worst case.( like random Quick sort probability is involved here  ) . 
    It is very unlikely a skip list data structure will be significantly unbalanced.</b> 
  Skip lists have balanced properties similar to search trees built by random insertions , <b>yet do not require insertions to be random. </b>
  Skip lists do not require input sequence to be random , it consults random number generator for balancing.</p> 
 <p> 
Skip lists are also very space efficient. 
  They can be configured to require an average of 1.33 pointers per element (or even less) and
  do not require balance or priority information to be stored with each node.</p>
    
  <h2>TAG-LINE</h2><p>BALANCING A DATA STRUCTURE PROBABILISTICALLY IS EASIER THAN EXPLICITLY MAINTAINING THE BALANCE.</p>

      
<h2>SKIP-LIST</h2>
<p> 
  In the below figure (list is sorted in every case)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In this case while searching we have to examine every node.</li>
<li>In this every other node has a pointer to 2 nodes ahead in list. While searching we have to examine atmost ceil(n/2)+1.</li>
    <li>In  this case every 4<sup>th</sup> node has a pointer to 4 nodes ahead. We dont require more than ceil(n/4)+1 nodes to be examined.</li>
    <li>In this every 2<sup>i</sup> node has a pointer 2<sup>i</sup> nodes ahead. Examined nodes would be reduced to order ceil(logn). 
      This implementation can be used for fast searching but insertion and deletion would be impractical in this implementation.
      (every 2<sup>nd</sup> node has pointer 2 nodes ahead; every 4<sup>th</sup> node has pointer 4 nodes ahead and so on.) 
      and i<sup>th</sup> forward pointer of node points to 2<sup>i-1</sup> nodes ahead.</li> 
      </ul>   
<h4>ABOVE IMPLEMENTATION IS IDEAL IMPLEMENTATION OF SKIPLIST AND SHOULD BE USED WHEN ONLY FAST SEARCHING IS TO BE DONE WHEN ALL ELEMENTS ARE PRESENT.(NO INSERTION OR DELETION ,because for 1 insertion and deletion many pointers have to be changed)</h4>

    <center>Fig 1</center>
    <br>
    <ul>
   <li>A node having k forward pointers is level k node.</li>
   <li>If every 2<sup>i</sup> node has  pointer 2<sup>i</sup> nodes ahead then levels are distributed in a simple pattern :50% are level 1 , 
 25% are level 2 , 12.5% are level 3 and so on.Till now the implementation we have discussed , no randomness is embedded in that.</li>
      </ul>  
 
 <h2>MAIN IMPLEMENTATION: </h2>
<p>What would happen if levels of nodes were chosen randomly but in same proportions (percentage) discussed above like eg (e).
In (e) a nodeâ€™s ith forward pointer instead of pointing 2<sup>i-1</sup> nodes ahead , points to next node of level i or higher.
	Insertion and deletion would require only <b>local modification (main difference from ideal skiplist)</b>; the level of node is chosen randomly when node is inserted and never change.
</p>   
<p>
Each element is represented by a node having key value pair,the level of which is chosen at random when the node is inserted without
regard for number of elements in it. Level i means i forward pointers(1 to i). We do not need to store the level of node in the node.
MAX_LEVEL variable represents max level permitted. The level variable represents the current max level in the list or 1 if the list is 	empty.
The header of list has forward pointers at levels 1 to MAX_LEVEL. Forward pointers of header above current maximum level of list points to NIL.
</p>

<p>
	Understanding of NIL is very important. We will discuss some later.
</p>

<h3>Structure of node</h3>

<pre>
	typedef struct <b>node</b>
		{	
			int key;
			int value;
			struct node ** forward; <b>//pointer to a pack of forward pointers</b>
		}node;
</pre> 
	  
<h3>Structure of list</h3>
<pre>
	typedef struct <b>skiplist</b>
		{
			int level;<b>//current max level</b>
			int size;<b>//size of list</b>
			struct node * header;<b>//this is important discussed below</b>
		}skiplist;
</pre>
<img src="images/2.png" alt="hiii" class="inline"/><br>
	  
<h3>Initialisation</h3>
<p> Consider every node has 2 parts first key-value pair and second part is a pack of forward pointers. Pointer name forward is link between them.
 Our first node is special(header node) . It does not carry elements but it behaves as a starting point(only forward pointers no element) and
end point which is NIL. This node is given value INT_MAX to differentiate from others and also helps in stopping while searching.
</p>	
	  <br>
<pre>

	//only called once
	skiplist * <b>initialise</b>(skiplist *list)
	{
		node * header=(node *)malloc (sizeof(struct node));
		header->key=INT_MAX;
		header->forward=(node **)malloc(sizeof(node *)*(MAX_LEVEL+1));
		list->header=header;

		<b>//forward is pointer to pack of pointers of diff levels</b> 
		for (int i = 0; i <= MAX_LEVEL; ++i)
			header->forward[i]=list->header;<b>//because starting and end point are same.</b>

		list->level=1;<b>//empty list has level 1</b>
		list->size=0;<b>//initially list is empty</b>

		return list;
	}
</pre>

<h3>Searching</h3>
<p>
<ul><li>we start searching from current max level which is stored in level attribute of list. We search for an element by traversing forward
pointers that do not overshoot the node containing element being searched.</li><li> When traversing complete at current level of forward pointers
, the search moves down to next low level.</li><li> At the end when no more traversing can be done at level 1 , we will be immediately in front 
of node that contains that searched element(if it is present).</li> </ul> 
</p><br>
<pre>
node * <b>search</b>(skiplist * list,int s_key)
{
	node * x=list->header;
	<b>// list->level bcoz it is the max level at present <=MAX_LEVEL </b>
	for (int i = list->level; i >= 1; --i)
		while(x->forward[i]->key < s_key)
			x=x->forward[i];
	<b>// x->key < search_key <= x->forward[i]->key</b>
	<b>// < is when value is not present and = when value is present</b>
	
	x=x->forward[1];<b>// 1 because at the end you will be at level 1</b>
	if(x->key == s_key)
		return x;
	else 
		return NULL;
}
</pre>

<h3>Randomisation</h3>
<p><ul><li>
The implementation which we discussed for fast searching (not for insertion and deletion, that 2<sup>ith</sup> node
has pointer 2<sup>ith</sup> nodes ahead), here probabililistic distribution is such that among nodes that have level i pointer 
 half of them also have level i+1 pointers.</li>
 <li>In main implementation we define <b>fraction p</b> as fraction of nodes with level i pointers also have level i+1 pointers.<b>(in above discussion p=0.5).</b> 
 Level for node is generated randomly using below algorithm and i<sup>th</sup> forward pointer points to next node of level same or higher. 
Levels are generated without reference to number of elements in the list. </li>
<li>There are many other ways of randomisation, you can look into that on your on.</li>
<li>Main question is by how using this function we are getting same proportion as discussed in ideal skiplist.??<br>
A node will have level 2 pointer with probability (.5) . Similarly level 3 pointer will have probability of <b>0.5*0.5 = 0.25</b> and so on forother levels.
This all is true because we have taken p=0.5 .</li></ul>
</p><br>
<pre>
same as ideal skiplist( one for fast searching not insertion,deletion )
                                            proportion of elements
  level 1      Tail(p=0.5)                    50%  (odd numered)
  level 2      Head,Tail (0.25)               25%   (this case has .5*prob of previous case hence half proportion)
  level 3      Head,Head,Tail (0.125)         12.5%    
  level 4      Head,Head,Head,Tail (0.0625)   6.25%
  and so on...
  we have maintained p=0.5
</pre><br>
<pre>
# define MAX_LEVEL 6
# define p .5
</pre>
<pre>
<b>//A level is chosen for an element in effect by flipping a coin that has probablility p of coming up heads.</b> 
<b>//We keeping flipping until we get a "tails" or until the maximum number of levels is reached:</b>

int <b>random_level</b>()
{
	int new_Level=1;
	<b>//rand() generates random value between [0,1)</b>
	<b>//when rand() > p means we get tail.</b>
	while(rand() < p && new_Level < MAX_LEVEL)
		new_Level++;
	return new_Level;
}
</pre>	


<h3>Insertion</h3>
<p>
<ul><li>In insertion first step is to find that element(its position to be inserted). If element is present then change its value
otherwise create a node and insert it.</li><li> Here the most important element is Update attribute. If you are inserting new node(means node
to be inserted is not already present) , Update stores the node which will be on left side of new node and would be pointing on new node after insertion.</li>
<li>Update array index represents level number. New level of new node is given by random level function . Left side pointers of new node 
can be adjusted by using update[i]->forward[i] because these will be the elements new node will be pointing to(try to visualise be seeing
int the diagram. Update is filled while searching for the element.</li><li> Now at the end by seeing the index as level number and update element as node
you can update all pointers.</li></ul>

</p>
<br>
<pre>
int <b>insert</b>(skiplist *list,int s_key, int s_value)
{
	int level;
	node * update[MAX_LEVEL+1];
	node * x=list->header;
	for(int i=list->level; i>=1; i--)
	{
		while(x->forward[i]->key < s_key)
			x=x->forward[i];
			
<b>//here x-&gt;key &lt; s_key &lt;= x-&gt;forward[i]-&gt;key (judge x position)</b>
		update[i]=x;
	}
	x=x->forward[1];

	if(x->key==s_key)
	{
		x->value=s_value;
		return 0;
	}
	else
	{
		level=random_level();
		if(level > list->level)
		{
			for(int i=list->level+1;i<=level;i++)
				update[i]=list->header;
			list->level=level;
		}
		x=(node *)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
		x->key=s_key;
		x->value=s_value;
		x->forward=(node **)malloc(sizeof(node *)*(level+1));
		for(int i=1; i<= level;i++)
		{
			x->forward[i]=update[i]->forward[i];
			update[i]->forward[i]=x;
		}
	}
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<h3>Deletion</h3>
<p>
Here also first step is searching keeping an update array same as insertion(see insertion). Just remember 2 things here.
<ul>
<li>For a particular node if certain level forward pointer dose not points to a specific node then its higher level forward pointers will 
also not point to that node that why we started with 1 and used break in below code while updating.</li><li> Secondly at the end dont forget
to update the level beacuse may be we have deleted the node which had the highest current level.</li></ul>
</p>
<br>
<pre>
int <b>delete</b>(skiplist * list ,int s_key)
{
	node * update[MAX_LEVEL+1];
	node * x=list->header;
	for (int i = list->level; i >= 1; --i)
	{
		while(x->forward[i]->key < s_key)
			x=x->forward[i];
		update[i]=x;
	}
	x=x->forward[1];
	if(x->key == s_key){
		for (int i = 1; i <= list->level; ++i)
		{
			if(update[i]->forward[i]!=x)
				break;
			update[i]->forward[i]=x->forward[i];
		}
		free(x->forward);
		free(x);
		while(list->level>1 && list->header->forward[list->level]==list->header)
			list->level--;
	}
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<h3>dumping</h3>
<pre>
static void <b>dump</b>(skiplist *list)
{
    node *x = list->header;
    while (x && x->forward[1] != list->header) {
        printf("%d[%d]->", x->forward[1]->key, x->forward[1]->value);
        x = x->forward[1];
    }
    printf("NIL\n");
}
</pre>

<h3>Main function</h3>
<pre>
int <b>main</b>() 
{
    int arr[] = { 3, 6, 9, 2, 11, 1, 4 }, i;
    skiplist list;
    initialise(&list);
 
    printf("Insert:--------------------\n");
    for (i = 0; i < sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]); i++) {
        insert(&list, arr[i], arr[i]);
    }
    dump(&list);
 
    printf("Search:--------------------\n");
    int keys[] = { 3, 4, 7, 10, 111 };
 
    for (i = 0; i < sizeof(keys) / sizeof(keys[0]); i++) {
        node *x = search(&list, keys[i]);
        if (x) {
            printf("key = %d, value = %d\n", keys[i], x->value);
        } else {
            printf("key = %d, not fuound\n", keys[i]);
        }
    }

    printf("Search:--------------------\n");
    delete(&list, 3);
    delete(&list, 9);
    dump(&list);
 
    return 0;
}
</pre>
   <b>special case:</b>In a skip list of 16 elements with p=0.5, we might happen to have 9 elements with level 1, 
   3 elements with level 2, 3 elements of level 3 and 1 element of level 14.(very unlikely).
   How do we handle this case. If we follow standard algorithm and start search at level 14,
   we will do a lot of useless work.<br><br>

<h4>Now question arises at what level we should start searching ??</h4>
Ideally we should start searching at level L where we expect 1/p nodes (p=0.5 in our case) means L =log<sub>2</sub>n. So in our case L will be log<sub>2</sub>n. (because ideally last level will be log<sub>2</sub>n due to our proportions of different levels discussed earlier(50% level 1, 25% level 2, 12.5% level 3 qnd so on).

But we may deviate from ideal behaviour so how to handle this scenario??<br><br>
<strong>First solution:</strong> follow standard algorithm which we discussed. We start search at highest level (here 14) in the list. Doing this only adds a constant in our expected search time and moreover this special case is very rare.
<br><br>
<strong>Second solution:</strong> Although an element can contain any number of pointers like here 14, we can choose to utilise only log<sub>2</sub>n levels. It will complicate algorithms and wont increase performance much.
<br><br>
<strong>Third solution:</strong> If we generate random level greater then current level by more than 1 (not 1), we only take 1+ the current max level as the level of node. This works well but destroys our ability to analyze algorithms because the level of node is no longer completely random.
<br><br>

<h4>Determining MAX_LEVEL</h4>
Since we can put safe limit at levels at L(n)=log<sub>2</sub>n we should choose MaxLevel= log<sub>2</sub>N.( n is current no of elements and N is upper bound on number of elements in list n&lt;=N ).If p=0.5, using MaxLevel = 16 is appropriate for skip list containing up to N=2<sup>16</sup> elements.
